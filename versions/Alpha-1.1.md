## No More Tree Punching - Alpha 1.1

### Additions

<font size=3> Added an internal Data/Resource Pack called "Basic Tools". When enabled Basic Tools 
will change the recipes of all tools (swords included) while also changing textures of them slightly. 
There is a new item you can craft, Rope, which you will need to craft all the tools in Minecraft. 
By default Basic Tools Pack is enabled but it can be disabled by hand. </font>

### Fixes

<font size=3> Fixed log and wood blocks not dropping when mined with a Golden and/or Netherite Axe. </font>
